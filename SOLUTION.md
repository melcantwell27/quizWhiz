(If you didn't go with the boilerplate) Notes on design/architecture and rationale
Please leave notes for what languages / frameworks you chose, and why. Please leave instructions for how to run your solution locally.

FE: Next.js -> 
React website recommends using Next.js \;) It is React + some built-in goodies that help accelerate development like directory-based routing & Typescript. 
MUI: Love it, use it work. Seems to be industry-standard for flexible modern design. Great community support.


BE: Python/Django ->
Django is the ORM I'm most familiar with and has nice built-in features that don't require much configuration. In the future, I may continue to work on this project as a way to keep my skills sharp. For the sake of focusing on user-stories first, I didn't leverage Django's built-in auth (a no-password email registration), though if I wanted to add the authentication in, I'd use the user class and a lot of it would come "out of the box". 

DB: PostgreSQL
It's powerful & supports scalability well. I use this in my current software engineering role.
